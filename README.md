# VBA-challenge
Module 2 Challenge for GT Data Science Bootcamp
The file "VBA-Challenge.vbs" worked on "alphabetical_testing.xlsx" and "Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx".

It goes worksheet by worksheet to populate the Price Changes, Percent Changes, and Total Volume of each ticker.

Then it looks for the Greatest Percent Increase, Greatest Percent Decrease, and Greatest Total Volume 
among all the tickers and identifies them at the top of the spreadsheets.
